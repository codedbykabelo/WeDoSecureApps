 WeDoSecureApps

WeDoSecureApps is a simple Java Swing application that allows users to encrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher encryption technique.

Features
- Plain Text Input**: Enter your message in the "Plain message" area.
- Encrypt Message**: Uses a Caesar Cipher with a fixed shift of 3 to encrypt the message.
- Encrypted Message Output**: Displays the encrypted text in the "Encrypted message" area.
- Clear: Clear both text areas.
- Exit: Close the application.

Encryption Technique (Caesar Cipher)
The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions.  
In this app:
- Shift value = 3
- Example: HELLO â†’ KHOOR
- Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged.
